            I see you've stumbled upon this collection of publicly available files... How peculiar. In the remote case
            of you being my potential employer, I advise you to go to the <a href="/cv" class="visible-link">cv</a>
            section of this website, as this is the "personal" side of the website. <br>
            On the other hand, in the case of you being someone interested in what I do or just an admirer of this
            wonderful website, I wish you a pleasant and enjoyable experience :>
        </p>
